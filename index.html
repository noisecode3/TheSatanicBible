                <h1>PREFACE</h1>
                <p>
                    This book was written because, with very few exceptions, every tract
                    and paper, every "secret" grimoire, all the "great works" on the subject
                    of magic, are nothing more than sanctimonious fraud - guilt-ridden ramblings
                    and esoteric gibberish by chroniclers of magical lore unable or unwilling
                    to present an objective view of the subject. Writer after writer, in efforts
                    to state the principles of "white and black magic", has succeeded instead in
                    clouding the entire issue so badly that the would-be student of sorcery winds
                    up stupidly pushing a planchette over a Ouija board, standing inside a pentagram
                    waiting for a demon to present itself, limply tossing I-Ching yarrow stalks like
                    so many stale pretzels, shuffling pasteboards to foretell a future which has lost
                    any meaning, attending seminars guaranteed to flatten his ego - while doing
                    the same to his wallet - and in general making a blithering fool of himself
                    in the eyes of those who know!
                </p>

                    The true magus knows that occult bookshelves abound with the brittle relics of
                    frightened minds and sterile bodies, metaphysical journals of self-deceit, and
                    constipated rule-books of Eastern mysticism. Far too long has the subject of
                    Satanic magic and philosophy been written down by wild-eyed journalists of the
                    right-hand path.

                    The old literature is the by-product of brains festering with fear and defeat,
                    written unknowingly for the assistance of those who really rule the earth, and who,
                    from their Hellish thrones, laugh with noisome mirth.

                    The flames of Hell burn brighter for the kindling supplied by these volumes of hoary
                    misinformation and false prophecy.

                <p>
                    Herein you will find truth—and fantasy. Each is necessary for the other to exist;
                    but each must be recognized for what it is. What you see may not always please you;
                    but you will see!

                <p>
                The gods of the right‐hand path have bickered and quarreled for an entire age of earth.
                Each of these deities and their respective priests and ministers have
                attempted to find wisdom in their own lies. The ice age of religious thought
                can last but a limited time in this great scheme of human existence. The
                gods of wisdom‐defiled have had their saga, and their millennium hath
                become as reality. Each, with his own “divine” path to paradise, hath
                accused the other of heresies and spiritual indiscretions. The Ring of the
                Nibelungen doth carry an everlasting curse, but only because those who
                seek it think in terms of “Good” and “Evil”—themselves being at all times “Good.”
                The gods of the past have become as their own devils in order to live. Feebly, their
                ministers play the devil’s game to fill their tabernacles and pay the mortgages on their
                temples. Alas, too long have they studied “righteousness,”
                and poor and incompetent devils they make. So they all join hands in
                “brotherly” unity, and in their desperation go to Valhalla for their last great
                ecumenical council. “Draweth near in the gloom the twilight of the gods.”
                The ravens of night have flown forth to summon Loki, who hath set
                Valhalla aflame with the searing trident of the Inferno. The twilight is done.
                A glow of new light is borne out of the night and Lucifer is risen, once
                more to proclaim: “This is the age of Satan! Satan Rules the Earth!” The
                gods of the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic, and undefiled
                wisdom. The FLESH prevaileth and a great Church shall be builded,
                consecrated in its name. No longer shall man’s salvation be dependent on
                his self-denial. And it will be known that the world of the flesh and the
                living shall be the greatest preparation for any and all eternal delights!
                </p>
