        <h1>PREFACE</h1>
        <p>
            This book was written because, with very few exceptions, every tract
            and paper, every "secret" grimoire, all the "great works" on the subject
            of magic, are nothing more than sanctimonious fraud - guilt-ridden ramblings
            and esoteric gibberish by chroniclers of magical lore unable or unwilling
            to present an objective view of the subject. Writer after writer, in efforts
            to state the principles of "white and black magic", has succeeded instead in
            clouding the entire issue so badly that the would-be student of sorcery winds
            up stupidly pushing a planchette over a Ouija board, standing inside a pentagram
            waiting for a demon to present itself, limply tossing I-Ching yarrow stalks like
            so many stale pretzels, shuffling pasteboards to foretell a future which has lost
            any meaning, attending seminars guaranteed to flatten his ego - while doing
            the same to his wallet - and in general making a blithering fool of himself
            in the eyes of those who know!
        </p>
        <p>
            The true magus knows that occult bookshelves abound with the brittle relics of
            frightened minds and sterile bodies, metaphysical journals of self-deceit, and
            constipated rule-books of Eastern mysticism. Far too long has the subject of
            Satanic magic and philosophy been written down by wild-eyed journalists of the
            right-hand path.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old literature is the by-product of brains festering with fear and defeat,
            written unknowingly for the assistance of those who really rule the earth, and who,
            from their Hellish thrones, laugh with noisome mirth.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flames of Hell burn brighter for the kindling supplied by these volumes of hoary
            misinformation and false prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Herein you will find truth—and fantasy. Each is necessary for the other to exist;
            but each must be recognized for what it is. What you see may not always please you;
            but you will see!
        </p>

            Here is Satanic thought from a truly Satanic point of view.
