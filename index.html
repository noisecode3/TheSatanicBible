        <h1>PREFACE</h1>
        <p>
            This book was written because, with very few exceptions, every tract
            and paper, every "secret" grimoire, all the "great works" on the subject
            of magic, are nothing more than sanctimonious fraud - guilt-ridden ramblings
            and esoteric gibberish by chroniclers of magical lore unable or unwilling
            to present an objective view of the subject. Writer after writer, in efforts
            to state the principles of "white and black magic", has succeeded instead in
            clouding the entire issue so badly that the would-be student of sorcery winds
            up stupidly pushing a planchette over a Ouija board, standing inside a pentagram
            waiting for a demon to present itself, limply tossing I-Ching yarrow stalks like
            so many stale pretzels, shuffling pasteboards to foretell a future which has lost
            any meaning, attending seminars guaranteed to flatten his ego - while doing
            the same to his wallet - and in general making a blithering fool of himself
            in the eyes of those who know!
        </p>
        <p>
            The true magus knows that occult bookshelves abound with the brittle relics of
            frightened minds and sterile bodies, metaphysical journals of self-deceit, and
            constipated rule-books of Eastern mysticism. Far too long has the subject of
            Satanic magic and philosophy been written down by wild-eyed journalists of the
            right-hand path.
        </p>
        <p>
            The old literature is the by-product of brains festering with fear and defeat,
            written unknowingly for the assistance of those who really rule the earth, and who,
            from their Hellish thrones, laugh with noisome mirth.
        </p>
        <p>
            The flames of Hell burn brighter for the kindling supplied by these volumes of hoary
            misinformation and false prophecy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Herein you will find truth—and fantasy. Each is necessary for the other to exist;
            but each must be recognized for what it is. What you see may not always please you;
            but you will see!
        </p>

            Here is Satanic thought from a truly Satanic point of view.

        <h1>PROLOGUE</h1>
        <p>
            The gods of the right‐hand path have bickered and quarreled for an entire age of earth.
            Each of these deities and their respective priests and ministers have
            attempted to find wisdom in their own lies. The ice age of religious thought
            can last but a limited time in this great scheme of human existence. The
            gods of wisdom‐defiled have had their saga, and their millennium hath
            become as reality. Each, with his own “divine” path to paradise, hath
            accused the other of heresies and spiritual indiscretions. The Ring of the
            Nibelungen doth carry an everlasting curse, but only because those who
            seek it think in terms of “Good” and “Evil”—themselves being at all times “Good.”
            The gods of the past have become as their own devils in order to live. Feebly, their
            ministers play the devil’s game to fill their tabernacles and pay the mortgages on their
            temples. Alas, too long have they studied “righteousness,”
            and poor and incompetent devils they make. So they all join hands in
            “brotherly” unity, and in their desperation go to Valhalla for their last great
            ecumenical council. “Draweth near in the gloom the twilight of the gods.”
            The ravens of night have flown forth to summon Loki, who hath set
            Valhalla aflame with the searing trident of the Inferno. The twilight is done.
            A glow of new light is borne out of the night and Lucifer is risen, once
            more to proclaim: “This is the age of Satan! Satan Rules the Earth!” The
            gods of the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic, and undefiled
            wisdom. The FLESH prevaileth and a great Church shall be builded,
            consecrated in its name. No longer shall man’s salvation be dependent on
            his self-denial. And it will be known that the world of the flesh and the
            living shall be the greatest preparation for any and all eternal delights!
        </p>
        <p>
            REGIE SATANAS!
        </p>
        <p>
            AVE SATANAS!
        </p>
        <p>
            HAIL SATAN!

        <h1>THE NINE SATANIC STATEMENTS</h1>
        <img src="img/art9.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 33%;">
        <ol>
            <li>Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!</li>
            <li>Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams!</li>
            <li>Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self‐deceit!</li>
            <li>Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates!</li>
            <li>Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek!</li>
            <li>Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires!</li>
            <li>Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all‐fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all!</li>
            <li>Satan represents all of the so‐called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!</li>
            <li>Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years!</li>
        </ol>
