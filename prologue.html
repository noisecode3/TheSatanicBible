    <h1>PROLOGUE</h1>
    <p>
        The gods of the right‐hand path have bickered and quarreled for an entire age of earth.
        Each of these deities and their respective priests and ministers have
        attempted to find wisdom in their own lies. The ice age of religious thought
            can last but a limited time in this great scheme of human existence. The
            gods of wisdom‐defiled have had their saga, and their millennium hath
            become as reality. Each, with his own “divine” path to paradise, hath
            accused the other of heresies and spiritual indiscretions. The Ring of the
            Nibelungen doth carry an everlasting curse, but only because those who
            seek it think in terms of “Good” and “Evil”—themselves being at all times “Good.”
            The gods of the past have become as their own devils in order to live. Feebly, their
            ministers play the devil’s game to fill their tabernacles and pay the mortgages on their
            temples. Alas, too long have they studied “righteousness,”
            and poor and incompetent devils they make. So they all join hands in
            “brotherly” unity, and in their desperation go to Valhalla for their last great
            ecumenical council. “Draweth near in the gloom the twilight of the gods.”
            The ravens of night have flown forth to summon Loki, who hath set
            Valhalla aflame with the searing trident of the Inferno. The twilight is done.
            A glow of new light is borne out of the night and Lucifer is risen, once
            more to proclaim: “This is the age of Satan! Satan Rules the Earth!” The
            gods of the unjust are dead. This is the morning of magic, and undefiled
            wisdom. The FLESH prevaileth and a great Church shall be builded,
            consecrated in its name. No longer shall man’s salvation be dependent on
            his self-denial. And it will be known that the world of the flesh and the
            living shall be the greatest preparation for any and all eternal delights!
        </p>

            REGIE SATANAS!

        <h1>THE NINE SATANIC STATEMENTS</h1>
        <img src="img/art9.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 33%;">
        <ol>
            <li>Satan represents indulgence, instead of abstinence!</li>
            <li>Satan represents vital existence, instead of spiritual pipe dreams!</li>
            <li>Satan represents undefiled wisdom, instead of hypocritical self‐deceit!</li>
            <li>Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it, instead of love wasted on ingrates!</li>
            <li>Satan represents vengeance, instead of turning the other cheek!</li>
            <li>Satan represents responsibility to the responsible, instead of concern for psychic vampires!</li>
            <li>Satan represents man as just another animal, sometimes better, more often worse than those that walk on all‐fours, who, because of his “divine spiritual and intellectual development,” has become the most vicious animal of all!</li>
            <li>Satan represents all of the so‐called sins, as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification!</li>
            <li>Satan has been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has kept it in business all these years!</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>(FIRE) - THE BOOK OF SATAN</h1>
        <h2>THE INFERNAL DIATRIBE</h2>
        <p>
            The first book of the Satanic Bible is not an attempt to blaspheme as much
            as it is a statement of what might be termed “diabolical indignation.” The
            Devil has been attacked by the men of God relentlessly and without
            reservation. Never has there been an opportunity, short of fiction, for the
            Dark Prince to speak out in the same manner as the spokesmen of the Lord
            of the Righteous. The pulpit‐pounders of the past have been free to define
            “good” and “evil” as they see fit, and have gladly smashed into oblivion any who
            disagree with their lies—both verbally and, at times, physically. Their talk
            of “charity,” when applied to His Infernal Majesty, becomes an empty sham
            — and most unfairly, too, considering the obvious fact that without their
            Satanic foe their very religions would collapse. How sad, that the
            allegorical personage most responsible for the success of spiritual religions
            is shown the least amount of charity and the most consistent abuse — and by
            those who most unctuously preach the rules of fair play! For all the
            centuries of shouting‐down the Devil has received, he has never shouted
            back at his detractors. He has remained the gentleman at all times, while
            those he supports rant and rave. He has shown himself to be a model of
            deportment, but now he feels it is time to shout back. He has decided it is
            finally time to receive his due. Now the ponderous rule‐books of hypocrisy
            are no longer needed. In order to relearn the Law of the Jungle, a small,
            slim diatribe will do. Each verse is an inferno. Each word is a tongue of
            fire. The flames of Hell burn fierce . . . and purify! Read on and learn the Law.
        </p>
        <h2>THE BOOK OF SATAN I</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In this arid wilderness of steel and stone I raise up my voice that you may hear. To the East and to the West I beckon. To the North and to the South I show a sign proclaiming: Death to the weakling, wealth to the strong!</li>
            <li>Open your eyes that you may see, Oh men of mildewed minds, and listen to me ye bewildered millions!</li>
            <li>For I stand forth to challenge the wisdom of the world; to interrogate the “laws” of man and of “God”!</li>
            <li>I request reason for your golden rule and ask the why and wherefore of your ten commandments.</li>
            <li>Before none of your printed idols do I bend in acquiescence, and he who saith “thou shalt” to me is my mortal foe!</li>
            <li>I dip my forefinger in the watery blood of your impotent mad redeemer, and write over his thorn‐torn brow: The TRUE prince of evil — the king of slaves!</li>
            <li>No hoary falsehood shall be a truth to me; no stifling dogma shall encramp my pen!</li>
            <li>I break away from all conventions that do not lead to my earthly success and happiness.</li>
            <li>I raise up in stern invasion the standard of the strong!</li>
            <li>I gaze into the glassy eye of your fearsome Jehovah, and pluck him by the beard; I uplift a broad‐axe, and split open his worm‐eaten skull!</li>
            <li>I blast out the ghastly contents of philosophically whited sepulchers and laugh with sardonic wrath!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>THE BOOK OF SATAN II</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Behold the crucifix; what does it symbolize? Pallid incompetence hanging on a tree.</li>
            <li>I question all things. As I stand before the festering and varnished facades of your haughtiest moral dogmas, I write thereon in letters of blazing scorn: Lo and behold; all this is fraud!</li>
            <li>Gather around me, Oh! ye death‐defiant, and the earth itself shall be thine, to have and to hold!</li>
            <li>Too long the dead hand has been permitted to sterilize living thought!</li>
            <li>Too long right and wrong, good and evil have been inverted by false prophets!</li>
            <li>No creed must be accepted upon authority of a “divine” nature. Religions must be put to the question. No moral dogma must be taken for granted — no standard of measurement deified. There is nothing inherently sacred about moral codes. Like the wooden idols of long ago, they are the work of human hands, and what man has made, man can destroy!</li>
            <li>He that is slow to believe anything and everything is of great understanding, for belief in one false principle is the beginning of all unwisdom.</li>
            <li>The chief duty of every new age is to upraise new men to determine its liberties, to lead it towards material success — to rend the rusty padlocks and chains of dead custom that always prevent healthy expansion. Theories and ideas that may have meant life and hope and freedom for our ancestors may now mean destruction, slavery, and dishonor to us!</li>
            <li>As environments change, no human ideal standeth sure!</li>
            <li>Whenever, therefore, a lie has built unto itself a throne, let it be assailed without pity and without regret, for under the domination of an inconvenient falsehood, no one can prosper.</li>
            <li>Let established sophisms be dethroned, rooted out, burnt and destroyed, for they are a standing menace to all true nobility of thought and action!</li>
            <li>Whatever alleged “truth” is proven by results to be but an empty fiction, let it be unceremoniously flung into the outer darkness, among the dead gods, dead empires, dead philosophies, and other useless lumber and wreckage!</li>
            <li>The most dangerous of all enthroned lies is the holy, the sanctified, the privileged lie the lie everyone believes to be a model truth. It is the fruitful mother of all other popular errors and delusions. It is a hydra‐headed tree of unreason with a thousand roots. It is a social cancer!!</li>
            <li>The lie that is known to be a lie is half eradicated, but the lie that even intelligent persons accept as fact — the lie that has been inculcated in a little child at its mother’s knee — is more dangerous to contend against than a creeping pestilence!!!</li>
            <li>Popular lies have ever been the most potent enemies of personal liberty. There is only one way to deal with them: Cut them out, to the very core, just as cancers. Exterminate them root and branch. Annihilate them, or they will us!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>THE BOOK OF SATAN III</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>“Love one another” it has been said is the supreme law, but what power made it so? Upon what rational authority does the gospel of love rest? Why should I not hate mine enemies — if I “love” them does that not place me at their mercy?</li>
            <li>Is it natural for enemies to do good unto each other — and WHAT IS GOOD?</li>
            <li>Can the torn and bloody victim “love” the blood‐splashed jaws that rend him limb from limb?</li>
            <li>Are we not all predatory animals by instinct? If humans ceased wholly from preying upon each other, could they continue to exist?</li>
            <li>Is not “lust and carnal desire” a more truthful term to describe “love” when applied to the continuance of the race? Is not the “love” of the fawning scriptures simply a euphemism for sexual activity, or was the “great teacher” a glorifier of eunuchs?</li>
            <li>Love your enemies and do good to them that hate and use you — is this not the despicable philosophy of the spaniel that rolls upon its back when kicked?</li>
            <li>Hate your enemies with a whole heart, and if a man smite you on one cheek, SMASH him on the other!; smite him hip and thigh, for self‐preservation is the highest law</li>
            <li>He who turns the other cheek is a cowardly dog!</li>
            <li>Give blow for blow, scorn for scorn, doom for doom — with compound interest liberally added thereunto! Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, aye four‐fold, a hundred-fold! Make yourself a Terror to your adversary, and when he goeth his way, he will possess much additional wisdom to ruminate over. Thus shall you make yourself respected in all the walks of life, and your spirit—your immortal spirit—shall live, not in an intangible paradise, but in the brains and sinews of those whose respect you have gained.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>THE BOOK OF SATAN IV</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Life is the great indulgence — death, the great abstinence. Therefore, make the most of life — HERE AND NOW!</li>
            <li>There is no heaven of glory bright, and no hell where sinners roast. Here and now is our day of torment! Here and now is our day of joy! Here and now is our opportunity! Choose ye this day, this hour, for no redeemer liveth!</li>
            <li>Say unto thine own heart, “I am mine own redeemer.”</li>
            <li>Stop the way of them that would persecute you. Let those who devise thine undoing be hurled back to confusion and infamy. Let them be as chaff before the cyclone and after they have fallen rejoice in thine own salvation.</li>
            <li>Then all thy bones shall say pridefully, “Who is like unto me? Have I not been too strong for mine adversaries? Have I not delivered MYSELF by mine own brain and body?”</li>
            <li></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>THE BOOK OF SATAN V</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Blessed are the strong, for they shall possess the earth — Cursed are the weak, for they shall inherit the yoke!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the powerful, for they shall be reverenced among men — Cursed are the feeble, for they shall be blotted out!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the bold, for they shall be masters of the world — Cursed are the righteously humble, for they shall be trodden under cloven hoofs!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the victorious, for victory is the basis of right — Cursed are the vanquished, for they shall be vassals forever!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the iron‐handed, for the unfit shall flee before them — Cursed are the poor in spirit, for they shall be spat upon!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the death‐defiant, for their days shall be long in the land — Cursed are the gazers toward a richer life beyond the grave, for they shall perish amidst plenty!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the destroyers of false hope, for they are the true Messiahs — Cursed are the god‐adorers, for they shall be shorn sheep!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the valiant, for they shall obtain great treasure — Cursed are the believers in good and evil, for they are frightened by shadows!</li>
            <li>Blessed are those that believe in what is best for them, for never shall their minds be terrorized — Cursed are the “lambs of God,” for they shall be bled whiter than snow!</li>
            <li>Blessed is the man who has a sprinkling of enemies, for they shall make him a hero — Cursed is he who doeth good unto others who sneer upon him in return, for he shall be despised!</li>
            <li>Blessed are the mighty‐minded, for they shall ride the whirlwinds — Cursed are they who teach lies for truth and truth for lies, for they are an abomination!</li>
            <li>Thrice cursed are the weak whose insecurity makes them vile, for they shall serve and suffer!</li>
            <li>The angel of self‐deceit is camped in the souls of the “righteous” — The eternal flame of power through joy dwelleth within the flesh of the Satanist!</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>(AIR) - THE BOOK OF LUCIFER</h1>
        <h2>THE ENLIGHENMENT</h2>
        <p>
            The Roman god, Lucifer, was the bearer of light, the spirit of the air, the
            personification of enlightenment. In Christian mythology he became
            synonymous with evil, which was only to have been expected from a
            religion whose very existence is perpetuated by clouded definitions and
            bogus values! It is time to set the record straight.
            False moralisms and occult inaccuracies must be corrected. Entertaining as
            they might be, most stories and plays about Devil worship must be
            recognized as the obsolete absurdities they are. It has been said “the truth
            will make men free.” The truth alone has never set anyone free. It is only
            DOUBT which will bring mental emancipation. Without the wonderful
            element of doubt, the doorway through which truth passes would be tightly
            shut, impervious to the most strenuous poundings of a thousand Lucifers.
            How understandable that Holy Scripture should refer to the Infernal
            monarch as the “father of lies”—a magnificent example of character
            inversion. If one is to believe this theological accusation that the Devil
            represents falsehood, then it surely must be concurred that it was HE, NOT
            GOD, THAT ESTABLISHED ALL SPIRITUAL RELIGIONS AND WHO
            WROTE ALL OF THE
            HOLY BIBLES! When one doubt is followed by another, the bubble, grown
            large from long accumulated fallacies, threatens to burst. For those who
            already doubt supposed truths, this book is revelation. Then Lucifer will
            have risen. Now is the time for doubt! The bubble of falsehood is bursting
            and its sound is the roar of the world!
        </p>
        <h2>W A N T E D ! GOD - DEAD OR ALIVE</h2>
        <img src="img/art.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 15%;">
        <p>
            IT is a popular misconception that the Satanist does not believe in God. The
            concept of “God,” as interpreted by man, has been so varied throughout the
            ages, I that the Satanist simply accepts the definition which suits him best.
            Man has always created his gods, rather than his gods creating him. God is,
            to some, benign — to others, terrifying. To the Satanist “God” — by whatever
            name he is called, or by no name at all — is seen as the balancing factor in
            nature, and not as being concerned with suffering. This powerful force
            which permeates and balances the universe is far too impersonal to care
            about the happiness or misery of flesh‐and‐blood creatures on this ball of
            dirt upon which we live.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone who thinks of Satan as evil should consider all the men, women,
            children, and animals who have died because it was “God’s will.” Certainly
            a person grieving the untimely loss of a loved one would much rather have
            their loved one with them than in God’s hands! Instead, they are unctuously
            consoled by their clergyman who says, “It was God’s will, my dear”; or “He
            is in God’s hands now, my son.” Such phrases have been a convenient way
            for religionists to condone or excuse the mercilessness of God. But if God
            is in complete control and as benign as he is supposed to be, why does He
            allow these things to happen? Too long have religionists been falling back
            on their bibles and rulebooks to prove or disprove, justify, condemn, or
            interpret.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Satanist realizes that man, and the action and reaction of the universe,
            is responsible for everything, and doesn’t mislead himself into thinking that
            someone cares.
            No longer will we sit back and accept “fate” without doing anything about
            it, just because it says so in Chapter such and such, Psalm so and so — and
            that’s that! The Satanist knows that praying does absolutely no good — in
            fact, it actually lessens the chance of success, for the devoutly religious too
            often sit back complacently and pray for a situation which, if they were to
            do something about it on their own, could be accomplished much quicker!
        </p>
        <p>
            The Satanist shuns terms such as “hope” and “prayer” as they are indicative
            of apprehension. If we hope and pray for something to come about, we will
            not act in a positive way which will make it happen. The Satanist, realizing
            that anything he gets is of his own doing, takes command of the situation
            instead of praying to God for it to happen.
            Positive thinking and positive action add up to results.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as the Satanist does not pray to God for assistance, he does not pray for
            forgiveness for his wrong doings. In other religions, when one commits a
            wrong he either prays to God for forgiveness, or confesses to an
            intermediary and asks him to pray to God for forgiveness for his sins. The
            Satanist knows that praying does no good, confessing to another human
            being, like himself, accomplishes even less — and is, furthermore,
            degrading.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a Satanist commits a wrong, he realizes that it is natural to make a
            mistake — and if he is truly sorry about what he has done, he will learn from
            it and take care not to do the same thing again. If he is not honestly sorry
            about what he has done, and knows he will do
            the same thing over and over, he has no business confessing and asking
            forgiveness in the first place. But this is exactly what happens. People
            confess their sins so that they can clear their consciences and be free to go
            out and sin again, usually the same sin.

            There are many different interpretations of God, in the usual sense of the
            word, as there are types of people. The images run from a belief in a god
            who is some vague sort of
            “universal cosmic mind” to an anthropomorphic deity with a long white
            beard and sandals who keeps track of every action of each individual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even within the confines of a given religion, the personal interpretations of
            God differ greatly. Some religions actually go so far as to label anyone who
            belongs to a religious sect other than their own a heretic, even though the
            overall doctrines and impressions of godliness are nearly the same. For
            example: The Catholics believe that the Protestants are doomed to Hell
            simply because they do not belong to the Catholic Church. In the same way,
            many splinter groups of the Christian faith, such as the evangelical or
            revivalist churches, believe that the Catholics are heathens who worship
            graven images. (Christ is depicted in the image that is most psychologically
            akin to the individual worshipping him, and yet the Christians criticize
            “heathens” for the worship of graven images.) And the Jews have always
            been given the Devil’s name.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though the god in all of these religions is basically the same, each
            regards the way chosen by the others as reprehensible, and to top it all,
            religionists actually PRAY for one another! They have scorn for the
            brothers of the right‐hand path because their religions carry different labels,
            and somehow this animosity must be released. What better way than
            through “prayer”! What a simperingly polite way of saying: “I hate your
            guts,” is the thinly disguised device known as praying for your enemy!
            Praying for one’s own enemy is nothing more than bargain‐basement anger,
            and of a decidedly shoddy and inferior quality!
        </p>
        <p>
            If there has been so much violent discrepancy as to the proper way in which
            to worship God, how many different interpretations of God can there be —
            and who is right?
        </p>
        <p>
            All devout “white‐lighters” are concerned with pleasing God so that they
            might have the
            “Pearly Gates” opened for them when they die. Nevertheless, if a man has
            not lived his life in accordance with the regulations of his faith, he can at
            the last minute call a clergyman to his deathbed for a final absolution. The
            priest or minister will then come running on the double, to “make
            everything right” with God and see to it that his passport to the Heavenly
            Realm is in order. (The Yezidis, a sect of Devil worshippers, take a different
            viewpoint. They believe that God is all‐powerful, but also all‐forgiving, and
            so accordingly feel that it is the Devil whom they must please, as he is the
            one who rules their lives while here on earth. They believe so strongly that
            God will forgive all of their sins once they have been given the last rites,
            that they feel no need to concern themselves with the opinion God may hold
            of them while they live.)
        </p>
        <p>
            With all of the contradictions in the Christian scriptures, many people
            currently cannot rationally accept Christianity the way it has been practiced
            in the past. Great numbers of people are beginning to doubt the existence of
            God, in the established Christian sense of the word. So, they have taken to
            calling themselves “Christian Atheists.” True, the Christian Bible is a mass
            of contradictions; but what could be more contradictory than the term
            “Christian Atheist?”
        </p>
        <p>
            If prominent leaders of the Christian faith are rejecting the past
            interpretations of God, how then can their followers be expected to adhere
            to previous religious tradition?
            With all the debates about whether or not God is dead, if he isn’t he had
            better have MEDICARE!

        <img src="img/art.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 15%;">
        <p>
            ALL religions of a spiritual nature are inventions of man. He has created an
            entire system of gods with nothing more than his carnal brain. Just because
            he has an A ego, and cannot accept it, he has to externalize it into some
            great spiritual device which he calls “God.”
        </p>
        <p>
            God can do all the things man is forbidden to do — such as kill people,
            perform miracles to gratify his will, control without any apparent
            responsibility, etc. If man needs such a god and recognizes that god, then he
            is worshipping an entity that a human being invented. Therefore, HE IS
            WORSHIPPING BY PROXY THE MAN THAT INVENTED GOD. Is it
            not more sensible to worship a god that he, himself, has created, in
            accordance with his own emotional needs — one that best represents the
            very carnal and physical being that has the idea‐power to invent a god in the
            first place?
        </p>
        <p>
            If man insists on externalizing his true self in the form of “God,” then why
            fear his true self, in fearing “God,” — why praise his true self in praising
            “God,” — why remain externalized from “God” IN ORDER TO ENGAGE
            IN RITUAL AND RELIGIOUS CEREMONY IN HIS NAME?
        </p>
        <p>
            Man needs ritual and dogma, but no law states that an externalized god is
            necessary in order to engage in ritual and ceremony performed in a god’s
            name! Could it be that when he closes the gap between himself and his
            “God” he sees the demon of pride creeping forth—that very embodiment of
            Lucifer appearing in his midst? He no longer can view himself in two parts,
            the carnal and the spiritual, but sees them merge as one, and then to his
            abysmal horror, discovers that they are only the carnal—AND ALWAYS
            WERE! Then he either hates himself to death, day by day—or rejoices that
            he is what he is!
        </p>
        <p>
            If he hates himself, he searches out new and more complex spiritual paths of
            “enlightenment” in hopes that he may split himself up again in his quest for
            stronger and more externalized “gods” to scourge his poor miserable shell.
            If he accepts himself, but recognizes that ritual and ceremony are the
            important devices that his invented religions have utilized to sustain his
            faith in a lie, then it is the SAME FORM OF RITUAL that will sustain his
            faith in the truth — the primitive pageantry that will give his awareness of
            his own majestic being added substance.
        </p>
        <p>
            When all religious faith in lies has waned, it is because man has become
            closer to himself and farther from “God”; closer to the “Devil.” If this is
            what the devil represents, and a man lives his life in the devil’s fane, with
            the sinews of Satan moving in his flesh, then he either escapes from the
            cacklings and carpings of the righteous, or stands proudly in his secret
            places of the earth and manipulates the folly‐ridden masses through his own
            Satanic might, until that day when he may come forth in splendor
            proclaiming “I AM A SATANIST! BOW DOWN, FOR I AM THE
            HIGHEST EMBODIMENT OF HUMAN LIFE!”
        </p>
        <h2>SOME EVIDENCE OF A NEW SATANIC AGE</h2>
        <img src="img/art.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 15%;">
        <p>
            THE seven deadly sins of the Christian Church are: greed, pride, envy, anger,
            gluttony, lust, and sloth. Satanism advocates indulging in each of these
            “sins” as they all lead to physical, mental, or emotional gratification.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Satanist knows there is nothing wrong with being greedy, as it only
            means that he wants more than he already has. Envy means to look with
            favor upon the possessions of others, and to be desirous of obtaining similar
            things for oneself.
            Envy and greed are the motivating forces of ambition — and without
            ambition, very little of any importance would be accomplished.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gluttony is simply eating more than you need to keep yourself alive. When
            you have overeaten to the point of obesity, another sin — pride — will
            motivate you to regain an appearance that will renew your self‐respect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyone who buys an article of clothing for a purpose other than covering
            his body and protecting it from the elements is guilty of pride. Satanists
            often encounter scoffers who maintain that labels are not necessary. It must
            be pointed out to these destroyers of labels that one or many articles they
            themselves are wearing are not wearing are not necessary to keep them
            warm. There is not a person on this earth who is completely devoid of
            ornamentation.
            The Satanist points out that any ornamentation of the scoffer’s body shows
            that he, too, is guilty of pride. Regardless of how verbose the cynic may be
            in his intellectual description of how free he is, he is still wearing the
            elements of pride.
        </p>
        <p>
            Being reluctant to get up in the morning is to be guilty of sloth, and if you
            lie in bed long enough you may find yourself committing yet another sin —
            lust. To have the faintest stirring of sexual desire is to be guilty of lust. In
            order to insure the propagation of humanity, nature made lust the second
            most powerful instinct, the first being self-preservation. Realizing this, the
            Christian Church made fornication the “Original Sin.” In this way they
            made sure no one would escape sin. Your very state of being is as a result of
            sin — the Original sin!
        </p>
        <p>
            The strongest instinct in every living thing is self‐preservation, which
            brings us to the last of the seven deadly sins — anger. Is it not our instinct for
            self‐preservation that is aroused when someone harms us, when we become
            angry enough to protect ourselves from further attack? A Satanist practices
            the motto, “If a man smite thee on one cheek, smash him on the other!” Let
            no wrong go unredressed. Be as a lion in the path — be dangerous even in
            defeat!
        </p>
        <p>
            Since man’s natural instincts lead him to sin, all men are sinners; and all
            sinners go to hell. If everyone goes to hell, then you will meet all your
            friends there. Heaven must be populated with some rather strange creatures
            if they all lived for was to go to a place where they can strum harps for
            eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Times have changed. Religious leaders no longer preach that all our
            natural actions are sinful. We no longer think sex is dirty — or that taking
            pride in ourselves is shameful — or
            that wanting something someone else has is vicious.” Of course not, times
            have changed! “If you want proof of this, just look at how liberal churches
            have become. Why, they’re practicing all the things that you preach.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanists hear these, and similar statements, all the time; and they agree
            wholeheartedly.
            BUT, if the world has changed so much, why continue to grasp at the
            threads of a dying faith?
            If many religions are denying their own scriptures because they are out of
            date, and are preaching the philosophies of Satanism, why not call it by its
            rightful name — Satanism?
            Certainly it would be far less hypocritical.
        </p>
        <p>
            In recent years there has been an attempt to humanize the spiritual concept
            of Christianity. This has manifested itself in the most obvious non‐spiritual
            means. Masses which had been said in Latin are now said in native
            languages — which only succeeds in making the nonsense easier to
            understand, and at the same time robs the ceremony of the esoteric nature
            which is consistent with the tenets of the dogma. It is much simpler to
            obtain an emotional reaction using words and phrases that cannot be
            understood than it is with statements which even the simplest mind will
            question when hearing them in an understandable language.
        </p>
        <p>
            If priests and ministers were to have used the devices to fill their churches
            one hundred years ago that they use today, they would have been charged
            with heresy, called devils, oft-times persecuted, but certainly
            excommunicated without hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The religionists wail, “We must keep up with the times,” forgetting that, due
            to limiting factors and deeply engrained laws of white light religions, there
            can never be sufficient change to meet the needs of man.
        </p>
        <p>
            Past religions have always represented the spiritual nature of man, with
            little or no concern for his carnal or mundane needs. They have considered
            this life but transitory, and the flesh merely a shell; physical pleasure trivial,
            and pain a worthwhile preparation for the
            “Kingdom of God.” How well the utter hypocrisy comes forth when the
            “righteous” make a change in their religion to keep up with man’s natural
            change! The only way that Christianity can ever completely serve the needs
            of man is to become as Satanism is NOW.
        </p>
        <p>
            It has become necessary for a NEW religion, based on man’s natural
            instincts, to come forth. THEY have named it. It is called Satanism. It is
            that power condemned that has caused the religious controversy over birth‐
            control measures — a disgruntled admission that sexual activity, for fun, is
            here to stay.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the “Devil” who caused women to show their legs, to titillate men — the
            same kind of legs, now socially acceptable to gaze upon, which are revealed
            by young nuns as they walk about in their shortened habits. What a
            delightful step in the right (or left) direction! Is it possible we will soon see
            “topless” nuns sensually throwing their bodies about to the “Missa
            Solemnis Rock”? Satan smiles and says he would like that fine — many nuns
            are very pretty girls with nice legs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many churches with some of the largest congregations have the most hand‐
            clapping, sensual music — also Satanically inspired. After all, the Devil has
            always had the best tunes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Church picnics, despite all of Aunt Martha’s talk about the Lord’s Bountiful
            Harvest, are nothing more than a good excuse for Sunday gluttony; and
            everyone knows that lots more than Bible reading goes on in the bushes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fund‐raising adjunct to many church bazaars is commonly known as a
            carnival,
            which used to mean the celebration of the flesh; now a carnival is okay
            because the money goes to the church so that it can preach against the
            temptations of the Devil! It will be said that these things are only pagan
            devices and ceremonies — that the Christians borrowed them. True, but the
            Pagans reveled in the delights of the flesh, and were condemned by the very
            same people who celebrate their rituals, but call them by different names.
        </p>
        <p>
            Priests and ministers are in the front lines of peace demonstrations, and
            lying on railroad tracks in front of trains carrying war materials, with as
            much dedication as their brothers of the cloth, from the same seminaries,
            who are blessing the bullets and bombs and fighting men as chaplains in the
            armed forces. Someone must be wrong, someplace. Could it be that Satan is
            the one qualified to act as accuser? Certainly they named him that!
        </p>
        <p>
            When a puppy reaches maturity it becomes a dog; when ice melts it is
            called water; when twelve months have been used up, we get a new
            calendar with the proper chronological name; when “magic” becomes
            scientific fact we refer to it as medicine, astronomy, etc. When one name is
            no longer appropriate for a given thing it is only logical to change it to a
            new one which better fits the subject. Why, then, do we not follow suit in
            the area of religion?
            Why continue to call a religion the same name when the tenets of that
            religion no longer fit the original one? Or, if religion does preach the same
            things that it always has, but its followers practice nearly none of its
            teachings, why do they continue to call themselves by the name given to
            followers of that religion?
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not believe in what your religion teaches, why continue to support
            a belief which is contradictory with your feelings. You would never vote for
            a person or issue you did not believe in, so why cast your ecclesiastical vote
            for a religion which is not consistent with your convictions? You have no
            right to complain about a political situation you have voted for or supported
            in any way — which includes sitting back and complacently agreeing with
            neighbors who approve the situation, just because you are too lazy or
            cowardly to speak your mind. So it is with religious balloting. Even if you
            cannot be aggressively honest about your opinions because of unfavorable
            consequences from employers, community leaders, etc., you can, at least,
            be honest with yourself. In the privacy of your own home and with close
            friends you must support religion which has YOUR best interests at heart.
        </p>

            “Satanism is based on a very sound philosophy,” say the emancipated. “But
            why call it Satanism? Why not call it something like ‘Humanism’ or a name
            that would have the connotation of a witchcraft group, something a little
            more esoteric — something less blatant.” There is more than one reason for
            this. Humanism is not a religion. It is simply a way of life with no
            ceremony or dogma. Satanism has both ceremony and dogma.
            Dogma, as will be explained, is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism differs greatly from all other so‐called white‐light, “white”
            witchcraft or magical groups in the world today. These self‐righteous and
            supercilious religions protest that their members use the powers of magic
            only for altruistic purposes. Satanists look with disdain upon “white”
            witchcraft groups because they feel that altruism is sinning on the lay‐away
            plan. It is unnatural not to have desire to gain things for yourself. Satanism
            represents a form of controlled selfishness. This does not mean that you
            never do anything for anyone else. If you do something to make someone
            for whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a sense of
            gratification.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism advocates practicing a modified form of the Golden Rule. Our
            interpretation of
            this rule is: “Do unto others as they do unto you”; because if you “Do unto
            others as you would have them do unto you,” and they, in turn, treat you
            badly, it goes against human nature to continue to treat them with
            consideration. You should do unto others as you would have them do unto
            you, but if your courtesy is not returned, they should be treated with the
            wrath they deserve.

            White witchcraft groups say that if you curse a person, it will return to you
            three‐fold, come home to roost, or in some way boomerang back to the
            sender. This is yet another indication of the guilt‐ridden philosophy which
            is held by these neo‐Pagan, pseudo‐Christian groups. White witches want to
            delve into witchcraft, but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma
            attached to it. Therefore, they call themselves white magicians, and base
            seventy‐five per cent of their philosophy on the trite and hackneyed tenets
            of Christianity. Anyone who pretends to be interested in magic or the occult
            for reasons other that gaining personal power is the worst kind of hypocrite.
            The Satanist respects Christianity for, at least, being consistent in its guilt‐
            ridden philosophy, but can only feel contempt for the people who attempt to
            appear emancipated from guilt by joining a witchcraft group, and then
            practice the same basic philosophy as Christianity.
        </p>

            White magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes, and
            black magic, we are told, is used only for selfish or “evil” reasons. Satanism
            draws no such dividing line. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder.
            The Satanist, being the magician, should have the ability to decide what is
            just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            During white magical ceremonies, the practitioners stand within a
            pentagram to protect themselves from the “evil” forces which they call
            upon for help. To the Satanist, it seems a bit two‐faced to call on these
            forces for help, while at the same time protecting yourself from the very
            powers you have asked for assistance. The Satanist realizes that only by
            putting himself in league with these forces can be fully and unhypocritically
            utilize the Powers of Darkness to his best advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a Satanic magical ceremony, the participants do NOT: join hands and
            dance “ring around the rosy” in a circle; burn candles of various colors for
            various wishes; call out the names of “Father, Son and Holy Ghost” while
            supposedly practicing Black Arts; pick a
            “Saint” for their personal guide in obtaining help for their problems; dunk
            themselves in smelly oils and hope the money comes in; meditate so they
            can arrive at a “great spiritual awakening”; recite long incantations with the
            name of Jesus thrown in for good measure, between every few words, etc.,
            etc., etc., ad nauseam!
        </p>
        <p>
            BECAUSE — This is NOT the way to practice Satanic magic. If you cannot
            divorce yourself from hypocritical self‐deceit, you will never be successful
            as a magician, much less a Satanist.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Satanic religion has not merely lifted the coin — it has flipped it
            completely over.
            Therefore, why should it support the very principles to which it is
            completely opposed by calling itself anything other than a name which is
            totally in keeping with the reversed doctrines which make up the Satanic
            philosophy? Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the
            flesh, the mundane, the carnal — all of which are ruled by Satan, the
            personification of the Left Hand Path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inevitably, the next question asked is: “Granted, you can’t call it humanism
            because
            humanism is not a religion; but why even have a religion in the first place if
            all you do is what comes naturally, anyway? Why not just do it?”
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern man has come a long way; he has become disenchanted with the
            nonsensical dogmas of past religions. We are living in an enlightened age.
            Psychiatry has made great strides in enlightening man about his true
            personality. We are living in an era of intellectual awareness unlike any the
            world has ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is all very well and good, BUT — there is one flaw in this new state of
            awareness. It is one thing to accept something intellectually, but to accept
            the same thing emotionally is an entirely different matter. The one need that
            psychiatry cannot fill is man’s inherent need for emotionalizing through
            dogma. Man needs ceremony and ritual, fantasy and enchantment.
            Psychiatry, despite all the good it has done, has robbed man of wonder and
            fantasy which religion, in the past, has provided.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism, realizing the current needs of man, fills the large grey void
            between religion and psychiatry. The Satanic philosophy combines the
            fundamentals of psychology and good, honest emotionalizing, or dogma. It
            provides man with his much needed fantasy.
            There is nothing wrong with dogma, providing it is not based on ideas and
            actions which go completely against human nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight line. If all
            the guilts that have been built up can be turned into advantages, it
            eliminates the need for intellectual purging of the psyche in an attempt to
            cleanse it from these repressions. Satanism is the only religion known to
            man that accepts man as he is, and promotes the rationale of turning a bad
            thing into a good thing rather than bending over backwards to eliminate the
            bad thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, after intellectually evaluating your problems through common
            sense and drawing on what psychiatry has taught us, if you still cannot
            emotionally release yourself from unwarranted guilt, and put your theories
            into action, then you should learn to make your guilt work for you. You
            should act upon your natural instincts, and then, if you cannot perform
            without feeling guilty, revel in your guilt. This may sound like a
            contradiction in terms, but if you will think about it, guilt can often add a
            fillip to the senses. Adults would do well to take a lesson from children.
            Children often take great delight in doing something they know they are not
            supposed to.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, times have changed, but man hasn’t. The basics of Satanism have
            always existed.
            The only thing that is new is the formal organization of a religion based on
            the universal traits of man. For centuries, magnificent structures of stone,
            concrete, mortar, and steel have been devoted to man’s abstinence. It is high
            time that human beings stopped fighting themselves, and devoted their time
            to building temples designed for man’s indulgences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though times have changed, and always will, man remains basically
            the same. For two thousand years man has done penance for something he
            never should have had to feel guilty about in the first place. We are tired of
            denying ourselves the pleasures of life which we deserve. Today, as always,
            man needs to enjoy himself here and now, instead of waiting for his rewards
            in heaven. So, why not have a religion based on indulgence? Certainly, it is
            consistent with the nature of the beast. We are no longer supplicating
            weaklings trembling before an unmerciful “God” who cares not whether we
            live or die. We are self‐respecting, prideful people — we are Satanists!

        <h2>HELL, THE DEVIL, AND HOW TO SELL YOUR SOUL</h2>
        <img src="img/art.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 15%;">
        <p>
            SATAN has certainly been the best friend the church has ever had, as he has
            kept it in business all these years. The false doctrine of Hell and the Devil
            has allowed the Protestant and Catholic Churches to flourish far too long.
            Without a devil to point S
            their fingers at, religionists of the right hand path would have nothing with
            which to threaten their followers. “Satan leads you to temptation”; “Satan is
            the prince of evil”;
            “Satan is vicious, cruel, brutal,” they warn. “If you give in to the
            temptations of the devil, you will surely suffer eternal damnation and roast
            in Hell.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The semantic meaning of Satan is the “adversary” or “opposition” or the
            “accuser.” The very word “devil” comes from the Indian devi which means
            “god.” Satan represents opposition to all religions which serve to frustrate
            and condemn man for his natural instincts. He has been given an evil role
            simply because he represents the carnal, earthly, and mundane aspects of
            life.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satan, the chief devil of the Western World, was originally an angel whose
            duty was to report human delinquencies to God. It was not until the
            Fourteenth Century that he began to be depicted as an evil deity who was
            part man and part animal, with goat‐like horns and hooves. Before
            Christianity gave him the names of Satan, Lucifer, etc., the carnal side of
            man’s nature was governed by the god which was then called Dionysus, or
            Pan, depicted as a satyr or faun, by the Greeks. Pan was originally the
            “good guy,” and symbolized fertility and fecundity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever a nation comes under a new form of government, the heroes of
            the past become villains of the present. So it is with religion. The earliest
            Christians believed that the Pagan deities were devils, and to employ them
            was to use “black magic.” Miraculous heavenly events they termed “white
            magic”; this was the sole distinction between the two.
            The old gods did not die, they fell into Hell and became devils. The bogey,
            goblin, or bugaboo used to frighten children is derived from the Slavonic
            “Bog” which means “god,”
            as does Bhaga in Hindu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many pleasures revered before the advent of Christianity were condemned
            by the new religion. It required little changeover to transform the horns and
            cloven hooves of Pan into a most convincing devil! Pan’s attributes could
            be neatly changed into charged‐with-punishment sins, and so the
            metamorphosis was complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            The association of the goat with the Devil is found in the Christian Bible,
            where the holiest day of the year, the Day of Atonement, was celebrated by
            casting lots for two goats
            “without blemish,” one to be offered to the Lord, and one to Azazel. The
            goat carrying the sins of the people was driven into the desert and became a
            “scapegoat.” This is the origin of the goat which is still used in lodge
            ceremonies today as it was also used in Egypt, where once a year it was
            sacrificed to a God.
        </p>
        <p>
            The devils of mankind are many, and their origins diversified. The
            performance of Satanic ritual does not embrace the calling forth of demons;
            this practice is followed only by those who are in fear of the very forces
            they conjure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Supposedly, demons are malevolent spirits with attributes conductive to the
            deterioration of the people or events that they touch upon. The Greek word
            demon meant a guardian spirit or source of inspiration, and to be sure, later
            theologians invented legion upon legion of these harbingers of inspiration — 
            all wicked.
        </p>
        <p>
            An indication of the cowardice of “magicians” of the right‐hand path is the
            practice of calling upon a particular demon (who would supposedly be a
            minion of the devil) to do his bidding. The assumption is that the demon,
            being only a flunky of the devil, is easier to control. Occult lore states that
            only the most formidably “protected” or insanely foolhardy sorcerer would
            try to call forth the Devil himself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Satanist does not furtively call upon these “lesser” devils, but brazenly
            invokes those who people that infernal army of long‐standing outrage — the
            Devils themselves!
        </p>
        <p>
            Theologians have catalogued some of the names of devils in their lists of
            demons, as might be expected, but the roster which follows contains the
            names and origins of the Gods and Goddesses called upon, which make up

            The devils of past religions have always, at least in part, had animal
            characteristics, evidence of man’s constant need to deny that he too is an
            animal, for to do so would serve a mighty blow to his impoverished ego.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pig was despised by the Jews and the Egyptians. It symbolized the gods
            Frey, Osiris, Adonis, Persephone, Attis, and Demeter, and was sacrificed to
            Osiris and the Moon. But, in
            time, it became degraded into a devil. The Phoenicians worshipped a fly
            god, Baal, from which comes the devil, Beelzebub. Both Baal and
            Beelzebub are identical to the dung beetle or scarabaeus of the Egyptians
            which appeared to resurrect itself, much as the mythical bird, the phoenix,
            rose from its own ashes. The ancient Jews believed, through their contact
            with the Persians, that the two great forces in the world were Ahura‐Mazda,
            the god of fire, light, life, and goodness; and Ahriman, the serpent, the god
            of darkness, destruction, death, and evil. These, and countless other
            examples, not only depict man’s devils as animals, but also show his need
            to sacrifice the original animal gods and demote them to his devils.

            At the time of the Reformation, in the Sixteenth Century, the alchemist, Dr.
            Johann Faustus, discovered a method of summoning a demon — 
            Mephistopheles — from Hell and making a pact with him. He signed a
            contract in blood to turn his soul over to Mephistopheles in return for the
            feeling of youth, and at once became young. When the time came for
            Faustus to die, he retired to his room and was blown to bits as though his
            laboratory had exploded. This story is a protest of the times (the Sixteenth
            Century) against science, chemistry, and magic.
        </p>
        <p>
            To the Satanist, it is unnecessary to sell your soul to the Devil or make a
            pact with Satan.
            This threat was devised by Christianity to terrorize people so they would
            not stray from the fold. With scolding fingers and trembling voices, they
            taught their followers that if they gave in to the temptations of Satan, and
            lived their lives according to their natural predilections, they would have to
            pay for their sinful pleasures by giving their souls to Satan and suffering in
            Hell for all eternity. People were led to believe that a pure soul was a
            passport to everlasting life.

            Pious prophets have taught man to fear Satan. But what of terms like “God
            fearing”? If God is so merciful, why do people have to fear him? Are we to
            believe there is nowhere we can turn to escape fear? If you have to fear
            God, why not be “Satan fearing” and at least have the fun that being God
            fearing denies you? Without such a wholesale fear religionists would have
            had nothing with which to wield power over their followers.

            The Teutonic Goddess of the Dead and daughter of Loki was named Hel, a
            Pagan god of torture and punishment. Another “L” was added when the
            books of the Old Testament were formulated. The prophets who wrote the
            Bible did not know the word “Hell”; they used the Hebrew Sheol and the
            Greek Hades, which meant the grave; also the Greek Tartaros, which was
            the abode of fallen angels, the underworld (inside the earth), and Gehenna,
            which was a valley near Jerusalem where Moloch reigned and garbage was
            dumped and burned. It is from this that the Christian Church has evolved
            the idea of “fire and brimstone” in Hell.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Protestant Hell and the Catholic Hell are places of eternal punishment;
            however, the Catholics also believe there is a “Purgatory” where all souls
            go for a time, and a
            “Limbo” where unbaptized souls go. The Buddhist Hell is divided into
            eight sections, the first seven of which can be expiated. The ecclesiastical
            description of Hell is that of a horrible place of fire and torment; in Dante’s
            Inferno, and in northern climes, it was thought to be an icy cold region, a
            giant refrigerator.

            (Even with all their threats of eternal damnation and soul roasting, Christian
            missionaries have run across some who were not so quick to swallow their
            drivel. Pleasure and pain, like beauty, are in the eye of the beholder. So,
            when missionaries ventured into Alaska and warned the Eskimos of the
            horrors of Hell and the blazing lake of fire awaiting
            transgressors, they eagerly asked: “How do we get there?”!)

            Most Satanists do not accept Satan as an anthropomorphic being with cloven hooves, a
            barbed tail, and horns. He merely represents a force in nature — the powers
            of darkness which have been named just that because no religion has taken
            these forces out of the darkness. Nor has science been able to apply
            technical terminology to this force. It is an untapped reservoir that few can
            make use of because they lack the ability use a tool without having to first
            break down and label all the parts which make it run. It is this incessant
            need to analyze which prohibits most people from taking advantage of this
            many faceted key to the unknown — which the Satanist chooses to call “Satan.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Satan, as a god, demi‐god, personal saviour, or whatever you wish to call
            him, was invented by the formulators of every religion on the face of the
            earth for only one purpose — to preside over man’s so‐called wicked
            activities and situations here on earth.
            Consequently, anything resulting in physical or mental gratification was
            defined as “evil” — thus assuring a lifetime of unwarranted guilt for everyone!
        </p>
        <p>
            So, if “evil” they have named us, evil we are — and so what! The Satanic
            Age is upon us! Why not take advantage of it and LIVE!

        <h2>LOVE AND HATE</h2>
        <img src="img/art.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 15%;">
        <p>
            SATANISM represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love
            wasted on ingrates! You cannot love everyone; it is ridiculous to think you
            can. If you love S everyone and everything you lose your natural powers of
            selection and wind up being a pretty poor judge of character and quality. If
            anything is used too freely it loses its true meaning. Therefore, the Satanist
            believes you should love strongly and completely those who deserve your
            love, but never turn the other cheek to your enemy!
        </p>
        <p>
            Love is one of the most intense emotions felt by man; another is hate.
            Forcing yourself to feel indiscriminate love is very unnatural. If you try to
            love everyone you only lessen your feelings for those who deserve your
            love. Repressed hatred can lead to many physical and emotional ailments.
            By learning to release your hatred towards those who deserve it, you
            cleanse yourself of these malignant emotions and need not take your pent‐up
            hatred out on your loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            There has never been a great “love” movement in the history of the world
            that hasn’t wound up killing countless numbers of people, we must assume,
            to prove how much they loved them! Every hypocrite who ever walked the
            earth has had pockets bulging with love!
        </p>
        <p>
            Every pharisaical religionist claims to love his enemies, even though when
            wronged he consoles himself by thinking “God will punish them.” Instead
            of admitting to themselves that they are capable of hating their foes and
            treating them in the manner they deserve, they say: “There, but for the grace
            of God, go I,” and “pray” for them. Why should we humiliate and lower
            ourselves by drawing such inaccurate comparisons?
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism has been thought of as being synonymous with cruelty and
            brutality. This is so only because people are afraid to face the truth — and the
            truth is that human beings are not all benign or all loving. Just because the
            Satanist admits he is capable of both love and hate, he is considered hateful.
            On the contrary, because he is able to give vent to his hatred through
            ritualized expression, he is far more capable of love — the deepest kind of
            love. By honestly recognizing and admitting to both the hate and the love
            he feels, there is no confusing one emotion with the other. Without being
            able to experience one of these emotions, you cannot fully experience the other.
        </p>
        <h2>SATANIC SEX</h2>
        <img src="img/art.jpg" alt="art" style="width: 15%;">
        <p>
            MUCH controversy has arisen over the Satanic views on “free love.” It is
            often assumed that sexual activity is the most important factor of the
            Satanic religion, M and that willingness to participate in sex‐orgies is a
            prerequisite for becoming a Satanist. Nothing could be farther from the
            truth! In fact, opportunists who have no deeper interest in Satanism than
            merely the sexual aspects are emphatically discouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism does advocate sexual freedom, but only in the true sense of the
            word. Free love, in the Satanic concept, means exactly that — freedom to
            either be faithful to one person or to indulge your sexual desires with as
            many others as you feel is necessary to satisfy your particular needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism does not encourage orgiastic activity or extramarital affairs for
            those to whom they do not come naturally. For many, it would be very
            unnatural and detrimental to be unfaithful to their chosen mates. To others,
            it would be frustrating to be bound sexually to just one person. Each person
            must decide for himself what form of sexual activity best suits his
            individual needs. Self‐deceitfully forcing yourself to be adulterous or to
            have sex partners when not married just for the sake of proving others (or
            worse yet, to yourself) that you are emancipated from sexual guilt is just as
            wrong, by Satanic standards, as leaving any sexual need unfulfilled because
            of ingrained feelings of guilt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of those who are constantly preoccupied with demonstrating their
            emancipation from sexual guilt are, in reality, held in even greater sexual
            bondage than those who simply accept sexual activity as a natural part of
            life and don’t make a big to‐do over their sexual freedom. For example, it is
            an established fact that the nymphomaniac (every man’s dream girl and
            heroine of all lurid novels) is not sexually free, but is actually frigid and
            roves from man to man because she is too inhibited to ever find complete
            sexual release.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another misconception is the idea that ability to engage in group sexual
            activity is the indicative of sexual freedom. All contemporary free‐sex
            groups have one thing in common — discouragement of fetishistic or deviant activity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Actually, the most forced examples of non‐fetishistic sexual activity thinly
            disguised as “freedom” have a common format. Each of the participants in an orgy
            removes all clothing, following the example set forth by one, and
            mechanically fornicate — also following the leader’s example. None of the
            performers consider that their “emancipated” form of sex might be regarded
            as regimented and infantile by non‐members who fail to equate uniformity
            with freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Satanist realizes that if he is to be a sexual connoisseur (and truly free
            from all sexual guilt) he cannot be stifled by the so‐called sexual
            revolutionists any more than he can by the prudery of his guilt‐ridden
            society. These free‐sex clubs miss the whole point of sexual freedom.
            Unless sexual activity can be expressed on an individual basis (which
            includes personal fetishes), there is absolutely no purpose in belonging to a
            sexual freedom organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your
            individual desires — be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual, if you
            choose. Satanism also sanctions any fetish or deviation which will enhance
            your sex‐life, so long as it involves no one who does not wish to be involved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prevalence of deviant and/or fetishistic behavior in our society would
            stagger the imagination of the sexually naïve. There are more sexual
            variants than the unenlightened individual can perceive: transvestism,
            sadism, masochism, urolagnia, exhibitionism — to name only a few of the
            more predominant. Everyone has some form of fetish, but because they are
            unaware of the preponderance of fetishistic activity in our society, they feel
            they are depraved if they submit to their “unnatural” yearnings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even the asexual has a deviation — his asexuality. It is far more abnormal to
            have a lack of sexual desire (unless illness or old‐age, or another valid
            reason has caused the wane) than it is to be sexually promiscuous.
            However, if a Satanist chooses sexual sublimination above overt sexual
            expression, that is entirely his own affair. In many cases of sexual
            sublimination (or asexuality), any attempt to emancipate himself sexually
            would prove devastating to the asexual.
        </p>
        <p>
            Asexuals are invariably sexually sublimated by their jobs or hobbies. All
            the energy and driving interest which would normally be devoted to sexual
            activity is channeled into other pastimes or into their chosen occupations. If
            a person favors other interests over sexual activity, it is his right, and no one
            is justified in condemning him for it.
            However, the person should at least recognize the fact that this is a sexual sublimation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of lack of opportunity for expression, many secret sexual desires
            never progress beyond the fantasy stage. Lack of release often leads to
            compulsion and, therefore, a great number of people devise undetectable
            methods of giving vent to their urges. Just because most fetishistic activity
            is not outwardly apparent, the sexually unsophisticated should not delude
            himself into thinking it does not exist. To cite examples of the ingenious
            techniques used: The male transvestite will indulge in his fetish by wearing
            feminine undergarments while going about his daily activities; or the
            masochistic woman might wear a rubber girdle several sizes too small, so
            she may derive sexual pleasure from her fetishistic discomfort throughout
            the day, with no one the wiser. These illustrations are far tamer and more
            prevalent examples than others which could have been given.
        </p>
        <p>
            Satanism encourages any form of sexual expression you may desire, so long
            as it hurts no one else. This statement must be qualified, to avoid
            misinterpretation. By not hurting another, this does not include the
            unintentional hurt felt by those who might not agree with your views on
            sex, because of their anxieties regarding sexual morality. Naturally, you
            should avoid offending others who mean a great deal to you, such as
            prudish friends and relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you earnestly endeavor to escape hurting them, and despite
            your efforts they accidentally find out, you cannot be held responsible, and
            therefore should feel no guilt as a result of either your sexual convictions,
            or their being hurt because of those convictions. If you are in constant fear
            of offending the prudish by your attitude towards sex, then there is no sense
            in trying to emancipate yourself from sexual guilt. However, no purpose is
            served by flaunting your permissiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The other exception to the rule regards dealings with masochists. A
            masochist derives pleasure from being hurt; so denying the masochist his
            pleasure‐through‐pain hurts him just as
            much as actual physical pain hurts the non‐masochist. The story of the truly
            cruel sadist illustrates this point: The masochist says to the sadist, “beat
            me.” To which the merciless sadist replies, “NO!” If a person wants to be
            hurt and enjoys suffering, then there is no reason not to indulge him in his wont.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term “sadist” in popular usage describes one who obtains pleasure from
            indiscriminate brutality. Actually, though, a true sadist is selective. He
            carefully chooses from the vast reserve of appropriate victims, and takes
            great delight in giving those who thrive on misery the fulfillment of their
            desires. The “well‐adjusted” sadist is epicurean in selecting those on whom
            his energies will be well‐spent! If a person is healthy enough to admit he is
            a masochist and enjoys being enslaved and whipped, the real sadist is glad to oblige!
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from the foregoing exceptions, the Satanist would not intentionally
            hurt others by violating their sexual rights. If you attempt to impose your
            sexual desires upon others who do not welcome your advances, you are
            infringing upon their sexual freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, Satanism does not advocate rape, child molesting, sexual
            defilement of animals, or any other form of sexual activity which entails the
            participation of those who are unwilling or whose innocence or naïveté
            would allow them to be intimidated or misguided into doing something
            against their wishes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If all parties involved are mature adults who willingly take full
            responsibility for their actions and voluntarily engage in a given form of
            sexual expression — even if it is generally considered taboo — then there is
            no reason for them to repress their sexual inclinations.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are aware of all the implications, advantages, and disadvantages, and
            are certain your actions will hurt no one who does not wish or deserve to be
            hurt, you have no cause to suppress your sexual preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as no two people are exactly the same in their choice of diet or have the
            same capacity for the consumption of food, sexual tastes and appetites vary
            from person to person. No person or society has the right to set limitations
            on the sexual standards or the frequency of sexual activity of another.
            Proper sexual conduct can only be judged within the context of each
            individual situation. Therefore, what one person considers sexually correct
            and moral may be frustrating to another. The reverse is also true; one person
            may have great sexual prowess, but it is unjust for him to belittle another
            whose sexual capacity may not equal his own, and inconsiderate for him to
            impose himself upon the other person, i.e., the man who has a voracious
            sexual appetite, but whose wife’s sexual needs do not match his own. It is
            unfair for him to expect her to enthusiastically respond to his overtures; but
            she must display the same degree of thoughtfulness. In the instances when
            she does not feel great passion, she should either passively, but pleasantly,
            accept him sexually, or raise no complaint if he chooses to find his needed
            release elsewhere — including auto‐erotic practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideal relationship is one in which the people are deeply in love with
            one another and are sexually compatible. However, perfect relationships are
            relatively uncommon. It is important to point out here that spiritual love and
            sexual love can, but do not necessarily, go hand in hand. If there is a certain
            amount of sexual compatibility, often it is limited; and some, but not all, of
            the sexual desires will be fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no greater sexual pleasure than that derived from association with
            someone you deeply love, if you are sexually well‐suited. If you are not
            suited to one another sexually,
            though, it must be stressed that lack of sexual compatibility does not
            indicate lack of spiritual love. One can, and often does, exist without the
            other. As a matter of fact, often one member of a couple will resort to
            outside sexual activity because he deeply loves his mate, and wishes to
            avoid hurting or imposing upon his loved one. Deep spiritual love is
            enriched by sexual love, and it is certainly a necessary ingredient for any
            satisfactory relationship; but because of differing sexual predilections,
            outside sexual activity or masturbation sometimes provides a needed supplement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Masturbation, considered a sexual taboo by many people, creates a guilt
            problem not easily dealt with. Much emphasis must be placed on this
            subject, as it constitutes an extremely important ingredient of many a
            successful magical working.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ever since the Judaeo‐Christian Bible described the sin of Onan (Gen. 38:7‐10),
            man has considered the seriousness and consequences of the “solitary
            vice.” Even though modern sexologists have explained the sin of Onan as
            simply coitus interruptus, the damage has been done through centuries of
            theological misinterpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Aside from actual sex crimes, masturbation is one of the most frowned
            upon sexual acts.
            During the last century, innumerable texts were written describing the
            horrific consequences of masturbation. Practically all physical or mental
            illnesses were attributed to the evils of masturbation. Pallor of the
            complexion, shortness of breath, furtive expression, sunken chest,
            nervousness, pimples and loss of appetite are only a few of the many
            characteristics supposedly resulting from masturbation; total physical and
            mental collapse was assured if one did not heed the warnings in those
            handbooks for young men.
        </p>

            The lurid descriptions in such texts would be almost humorous, were it not
            for the unhappy fact that even though contemporary sexologists, doctors,
            writers, etc. have done much to remove the stigma of masturbation, the
            deep‐seated guilts induced by the nonsense in those sexual primers have
            been only partially erased. A large percentage of people, especially those
            over forty, cannot emotionally accept the fact that masturbation is natural
            and healthy, even if they now accept it intellectually; and they, in turn,
            relate their repugnance, often subconsciously, to their children.

            It was thought that one would go insane if, despite numerous admonitions,
            his auto‐erotic practices persisted. This preposterous myth grew from
            reports of wide‐spread masturbation by the inmates of mental institutions. It
            was assumed that since almost all incurably insane people masturbated, it
            was their masturbation that had driven them mad. No one ever stopped to
            consider the lack of sexual partners of the opposite sex and the freedom
            from inhibition, which is a characteristic of extreme insanity, were the real
            reasons for the masturbatory practices of the insane.

            Many people would rather have their mates seek outside sexual activity
            than perform autoerotic acts because of their own guilt feelings, the mate’s
            repugnance towards having them engage in masturbation, or the fear of
            their mate’s repugnance — although in a surprising number of cases, a
            vicarious thrill is obtained from the knowledge that the mate is having
            sexual experiences with outsiders — although this is seldom admitted.

            If stimulation is provided by envisioning one’s mate sexually engaged with
            others, this should be brought out into the open where both parties may gain
            from such activities.
            However, if the prohibition of masturbation is only due to guilt feelings on
            the part of one or both parties, they should make every attempt to erase
            those guilts — or utilize them.
            Many relationships might be saved from destruction if the people involved
            did not feel guilt about performing the natural act of masturbation.

            Masturbation is regarded as evil because it produces pleasure derived from
            intentionally fondling a “forbidden” area of the body by one’s own hand.
            The guilt feelings accompanying most sexual acts can be assuaged by the
            religiously‐acceptable contention that your sensual delights are necessary to
            produce off‐spring — even though you cautiously watch the calendar for the
            “safe” days. You cannot, however, placate yourself with this rationale while
            engaging in masturbatory practices.

            No matter what you’ve been told about the “immaculate conception” — even
            if blind faith allows you to swallow this absurdity — you know full well if
            you are to produce a child, there must be sexual contact with a person of the
            opposite sex! If you feel guilty for committing the “original sin,” you
            certainly will feel even deeper guilt for performing a sex act only for self‐
            gratification, with no intention of creating children.

            The Satanist fully realizes why religionists declare masturbation to be
            sinful. Like all other natural acts people will do it, no matter how severely
            reprimanded. Causing guilt is an important facet of their malicious scheme
            to obligate people to atone for “sins” by paying the mortgages on temples of abstinence!

            Even if a person is no longer struggling under the burden of religiously‐induced
            guilt (or thinks he isn’t), modern man still feels shame if he yields
            to his masturbatory desires. A man may feel robbed of his masculinity if he
            satisfies himself auto‐erotically rather than engaging in the competitive
            game of woman chasing. A woman may satisfy herself sexually but yearns
            for the ego‐gratification that comes from the sport of seduction.
            Neither the quasi Casanova nor bogus vamp feels adequate when “reduced”
            to masturbation for sexual gratification; both would prefer even an
            inadequate partner.
            Satanically speaking, though, it is far better to engage in a perfect fantasy
            than to cooperate in an unrewarding experience with another person. With
            masturbation, you are in complete control of the situation.

            To illustrate the undebatable fact that masturbation is an entirely normal and
            healthy practice: it is performed by all members of the animal kingdom.
            Human children will also follow their instinctive masturbatory desires,
            unless they have been scolded for it by their indignant parents, who were
            undoubtably berated for it by their parents, and so on down the retrocedent line.

            It is unfortunate, but true, that the sexual guilts of parents will immutably be
            passed on to their children. In order to save our children from the ill‐fated
            sexual destiny of our parents, grandparents, and possibly ourselves, the
            perverted moral code of the past must be exposed for what it is: a
            pragmatically organized set of rules which, if rigidly obeyed, would destroy
            us! Unless we emancipate ourselves from the ridiculous sexual standards of
            our present society, including the so‐called sexual revolution, the neuroses
            caused by those stifling regulations will persist. Adherence to the sensible
            and humanistic new morality of Satanism can — and will — evolve society in
            which our children can grow up healthy and without the devastating moral
            encumbrances of our existing sick society.
