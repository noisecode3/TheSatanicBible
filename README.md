# The Satanic Bible
The purpose is to learn html/css coding from the ground up by hand. I happend to think The satanic Bible is a funny feel good book to read. On sundays we all bake bunns, drink milk and hold hands together. Maybe we add a synthetic voice for the rituals in java and style it with css.
